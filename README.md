# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my tiny space in the web! 🕸️ Currently it's a bit messy, as it has mix of all types of projects

- 🔭 personal, 4fun repos created to explore some ideas or learn new technology,
- 🎓 university assignments I thought are not too bad to display them publicly,
- 🎗️ certification projects which were needed by some courses and I also thought they aren't too bad,
- 🍴 forks of some other projects I wanted to contribute to or alter for my own needs.

Maybe one day I will clean it up... but probably not too much and not too soon 😃

## About me

I like trying new and "hot" things. New language features, tools, extensions, anything. Also, I really like reading about all the "Best practices" for anything I code and trying to stick to them as much as possible - project with solid unit test coverage, following SOLID principles and all the other funky mnemonics like KISS, DRY and YAGNI is my guilty pleasure 😃

I've written my first line of code in secondary school, but I'm still at the beginning of my professional career, so I'm still happy to explore different tools, technologies and programming areas. Also, my OSS contributions are pretty limited now, but I hope to have this fixed soon! 🎯

## TechTechTech

I tried multiple languages, frameworks etc., but for now my favorites are:

I'm also a big fan of coding with GitHub Copilot, but I there was no cool icon for it 🙃

So, yeah, I like Microsoft stuff and frontend, but I'm aiming to move a bit more into fullstack direction 🙂

## Some stats because there are cool pages to extract them

Aiming to make the language charts match my preferred languages some day 😅

## Other stuff

Sometimes I commit a blog post. Not too often, but maybe it will get better 🙂 Check my [dev.to](https://dev.to/voodu)!
